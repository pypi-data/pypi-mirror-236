	US CUSTOMARY UNITS:
		POUND:
		
		
		POUND OF FORCE:
			{ STANDARD ACCELERATION DUE TO GRAVITY } = (32.174049 FEET) / (SECONDS ^ 2)
				
		
			1 lbf = (1 POUND * 32.174049 FEET) / (SECONDS ^ 2)
			
			
			CONVERSION:
				1 POUND OF FORCE 							=	4.448222 NEWTONS
				(1 POUND * 32.174049 FEET) / (SECONDS ^ 2)	=	(.45 KILOGRAMS * 9.80665 METERS) / (SECONDS ^ 2)
				
		
		POUNDAL:
			POUNDAL = (1 POUND * 1 FOOT) / (SECONDS ^ 2)

	SYSTEM INTERNATIONAL:
		1 NEWTON:
						
			1 NEWTON = (1 KILOGRAM * METERS) / (SECONDS ^ 2)
			
			
			EXAMPLES:
				(50 kg) * (9.90665 METERS / SECONDS ** 2) ~= 495.3325 NEWTONS
