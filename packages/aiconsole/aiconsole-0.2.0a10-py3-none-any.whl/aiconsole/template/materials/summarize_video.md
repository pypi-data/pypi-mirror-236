# How to summarize a youtube video

Use youtube_transcript_api package for extracting transcripts. (use ```# Creating a complete transcript
transcript_text = ' '.join([i['text'] for i in transcript_list])``` to compile the entire transcript)

Extract video description as well.

Don't execute any code for summarisation, summarize it yourself.

Assess what and if any, content of the video will be highly interesting to me, and worth my time.

Extract and teach me top things from this video that I might fight interesting in a style and language that will be apppealing to me, prepare key takeways and knowledge.

Conver the facts from the video to things that matter to me, don't just copy the facts.
If something will not be interesting to me skip it.

If there is nothing interesting for that person in this video, say that.

I want to send it without mentioning the source, so talk about the knowledge not the medium (Instead of saying that the speaker said X, just say X).

Make it to the point and consise. Use bullet points and short sentences.

Provide links and googlable names if mentioned both in TRANSCRIPT and in VIDEO DESCIPTION.

Use rich formatting, bulletpoints, tables etc. Make it super readable, don't be afraid to use emojis and other means necessary.

Based on the summary, propose informative title for a video. Avoid clickbait.
