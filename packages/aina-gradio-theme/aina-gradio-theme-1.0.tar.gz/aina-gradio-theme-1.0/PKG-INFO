Aina Theme is a custom Gradio theme inspired by the visual style of Storj theme. Feel free to use this theme to create Gradio apps that have a visual connection to the world of cloud technology.

### How to edit Aina Gradio Theme colors and properties?

In case you would like to change theme properties, just edit ```AinaTheme/__init__.py``` file.

There are custom colors that you can set at ```utils/custom_colors.py```.

### How to use this theme in my Gradio app?
First install the theme package.
```bash
pip install git+https://gitlab.bsc.es/projecte-aina/aina-gradio-theme@<TAG_VERSION>
```
Once you have installed it, add it to the interface/block parameters.
```
#Using Blocks instance
with gr.Blocks(**AinaGradioTheme().get_kwargs()) as demo:
...
#Using Interface instance
iface = gr.Interface(
    **AinaGradioTheme().get_kwargs(),
```
#### NOTE: You need to call the ```get_kwargs``` function.

Why? Because this will spread theme arguments. It needs to be this way because it's mandatory to load the custom CSS.

So just instance the theme using the function.
```
**AinaGradioTheme().get_kwargs()
```
