            prompt_id=230621,
        )
        
        res = s.call.initiate_call(req)
        
        if res.initiate_call_200_application_json_object is not None:
            # handle response
            pass

        <!-- Start Pagination -->
        # Pagination
        
        Some of the endpoints in this SDK support pagination. To use pagination, you make your SDK calls as usual, but the
        returned response object will have a `Next` method that can be called to pull down the next group of results. If the
        return value of `Next` is `None`, then there are no more pages to be fetched.
        
        Here's an example of one such pagination call:
        <!-- End Pagination -->
        
        <!-- Placeholder for Future Speakeasy SDK Sections -->
        
        
        
        ### Maturity
        
        This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
        to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
        looking for the latest version.
        
        ### Contributions
        
        While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
        Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release!
