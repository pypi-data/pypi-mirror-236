## Description and context

APIlyzer is a Python library aimed at analyzing the maturity level of REST APIs, following the Richardson maturity model. The goal of this library is to evaluate APIs and generate a report on their maturity level, along with recommendations for improvements so that the API reaches the desired maturity level.
> Note: The library is still in development, so it does not have all the features we want to implement.


## Documentation

The complete documentation, containing all the details of the project, can be accessed at:
[https://apilyzer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://apilyzer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed on your system before proceeding with the installation.


## Installation Guide

We recommend creating a virtual environment to install the library in an isolated manner. Follow the commands below for installation:


```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
```	

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate # Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate # Windows
```

```bash
# Install the library
pip install apilyzer
```

## How to use?

APIlyzer offers a command line interface (CLI) for analyzing REST APIs. To know the available commands, run:

```bash
apilyzer
```

Currently, there are 3 subcommands available for this application:

- `verify-rest`: Checks if a REST API is documented based on the provided URL and if it is, returns the API response.

- `verify-maturity`: Analyzes the maturity level of a REST API based on the Richardson maturity model.

- `test-rate`: Performs a number of requests (100 by default) to the API with the aim of validating whether the API has a limit for the number of requests.

Examples of use:

```bash
apilyzer verify-rest https://petstore.swagger.io -e v2/swagger
```
```bash
apilyzer verify-maturity https://picpay.github.io/picpay-docs-digital-payments/swagger/checkout.json
```
```bash
apilyzer test-rate https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/pet
```

## More information about the CLI

For more information about the CLI, just run the command below:

```bash
apilyzer --help
```

For more information on CLI subcommands, just run the command below:

```bash
apilyzer <subcommand> --help
```
