              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Arabica
**Python package for exploratory text data analysis**

Text data is often recorded as a time series with significant variability over time. Some examples of time-series text data include social media conversations, product reviews, research metadata, central bankers’ communication, and newspaper headlines. Arabica makes exploratory analysis of these datasets simple by providing:

* **Descriptive n-gram analysis**: n-gram frequencies
* **Time-series n-gram analysis**: n-gram frequencies over a period
* **Text visualization**: n-gram heatmap, line plot, word cloud
* **Sentiment analysis**: VADER sentiment classifier
* **Financial sentiment analysis**: with FinVADER
* **Structural breaks identification**: Jenks Optimization Method

It automatically cleans data from punctuation on input. It can also apply all or a selected combination of the following cleaning operations:

* Remove digits from the text
* Remove the standard list(s) of stopwords
* Remove an additional list of stop words

Arabica works with **texts** of languages based on the Latin alphabet, uses `cleantext` for punctuation cleaning, and enables stop words removal for languages in the `NLTK` corpus of stopwords.

It reads dates in:

* **US-style**: *MM/DD/YYYY* (2013-12-31, Feb-09-2009, 2013-12-31 11:46:17, etc.)
* **European-style**: *DD/MM/YYYY* (2013-31-12, 09-Feb-2009, 2013-31-12 11:46:17, etc.) date and datetime formats.


## Installation

Arabica requires [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org) - stop words removal,
[cleantext](https://pypi.org/project/cleantext/#description) - text cleaning, [wordcloud](https://pypi.org/project/wordcloud) - word cloud visualization,
[plotnine](https://pypi.org/project/plotnine) - heatmaps and line graphs, [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/) - word clouds and graphical operations,
[vaderSentiment](https://pypi.org/project/vaderSentiment) - sentiment analysis, [finvader](https://pypi.org/project/finvader) - financial sentiment analysis,
and [jenskpy](https://pypi.org/project/jenkspy/) for breakpoint identification.

To install using pip, use:

`pip install arabica`

## Usage

* **Import the library**:


``` python
from arabica import arabica_freq
from arabica import cappuccino
from arabica import coffee_break 
```



* **Choose a method:**

**arabica_freq** enables a specific set of cleaning operations (lower casing, numbers, common stop words, and additional stop words
removal) and returns a dataframe with aggregated unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams frequencies over a period.



``` python
def arabica_freq(text: str,                # Text
                 time: str,                # Time
                 date_format: str,         # Date format: 'eur' - European, 'us' - American
                 time_freq: str = '',      # Aggregation period: 'Y'/'M'/'D', if no aggregation: 'ungroup'
                 max_words: int = '',      # Maximum of most frequent n-grams displayed for each period
                 stopwords: [],            # Languages for stop words
                 skip: [],                 # Remove additional stop words
                 numbers: bool = False,    # Remove numbers
                 lower_case: bool = False  # Lowercase text
) 
```

**cappuccino**  enables cleaning operations (lower casing, numbers, common stop words, and additional stop words
removal) and provides plots for descriptive (word cloud) and time-series (heatmap, line plot) visualization.

``` python
def cappuccino(text: str,                # Text
               time: str,                # Time
               date_format: str,         # Date format: 'eur' - European, 'us' - American
               plot: str = '',           # Chart type: 'wordcloud'/'heatmap'/'line'
               ngram: int = '',          # N-gram size, 1 = unigram, 2 = bigram, 3 = trigram
               time_freq: str = '',      # Aggregation period: 'Y'/'M', if no aggregation: 'ungroup'
               max_words int = '',       # Maximum of most frequent n-grams displayed for each period
               stopwords: [],            # Languages for stop words
               skip: [],                 # Remove additional stop words
               numbers: bool = False,    # Remove numbers
               lower_case: bool = False  # Lowercase text
```

**coffee_break**  provides sentiment analysis and breakpoint identification in aggregated time series of sentiment. The implemented models are:

* [VADER](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/14550) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment classifier attuned explicitly to general language expressed in social media

* [FinVADER](https://pypi.org/project/finvader/) improves VADER's classification accuracy on financial texts, including two financial lexicons

Break points in the time series are identified with the **Fisher-Jenks algorithm** (Jenks, 1977. Optimal data classification for choropleth maps).


``` python
def coffee_break(text: str,                 # Text
                 time: str,                 # Time
                 date_format: str,          # Date format: 'eur' - European, 'us' - American
                 model: str,                # Sentiment classifier, 'vader' - general language, 'finvader' - financial text                
                 skip: [],                  # Remove additional stop words
                 preprocess: bool = False,  # Clean data from numbers and punctuation
                 time_freq: str ='',        # Aggregation period: 'Y'/'M'
                 n_breaks: int =''          # Number of breakpoints: min. 2
)
```
