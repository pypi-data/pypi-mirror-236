        Parameters
        ----------
        use_border
            If `True`, all coordinates of both `source` mesh grids have pixels outside their border relocated to
            their edge (see `relocated_grid_from()`).
        is_stochastic
            Cetrain pixelizations can create different discretizations using the same parameters / inputs, by changing
            their random seed (e.g. changing the KMeans seed of the `VoronoiBrightnessImage` pixelization). If `True`,
            this random seed changes for every function call, creating completely stochastic pixelizations every time.
        kmeans_seed
            A fixed value for the KMeans seed that dictates the pixelization that is derived for
            a `VoronoiBrightnessImage` pixelization.
