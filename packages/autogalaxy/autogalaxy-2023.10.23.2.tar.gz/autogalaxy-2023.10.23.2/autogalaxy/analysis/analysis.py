        It is common for the model to have components whose parameters are all fixed, and thus the way that component

        Preloading exploits this to speed up the log likelihood function, by inspecting the model and storing in memory
        quantities that do not change. For the example above, the image of all galaxies would be stored in memory and

        Using a the result of a previous model-fit, a adapt-dataset can be set up which adapts aspects of the model

        If the model-fit is being resumed from a previous run, this function checks that the model image and galaxy
        images used to set up the adapt-dataset are identical to those used previously. If they are not, it replaces

        """
        Changes to the PyAutoGalaxy source code may inadvertantly change the numerics of how a log likelihood is
        computed. Equally, one may set off a model-fit that resumes from previous results, but change the settings of
        the pixelization or inversion in a way that changes the log likelihood function.

        This function performs an optional sanity check, which raises an exception if the log likelihood calculation
        changes, to ensure a model-fit is not resumed with a different likelihood calculation to the previous run.

        If the model-fit has not been performed before (e.g. it is not a resume) this function outputs
        the `figure_of_merit` (e.g. the log likelihood) of the maximum log likelihood model at the end of the model-fit.

        If the model-fit is a resume, it loads this `figure_of_merit` and compares it against a new value computed for
        the resumed run (again using the maximum log likelihood model inferred). If the two likelihoods do not agree
        and therefore the log likelihood function has changed, an exception is raised and the code execution terminated.

        Parameters
        ----------
        paths
            The PyAutoFit paths object which manages all paths, e.g. where the non-linear search outputs are stored,
            visualization, and pickled objects used by the database and aggregator.
