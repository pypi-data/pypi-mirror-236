        A class representing a Imaging observation, using the shape of the image, the pixel scale,
        psf, exposure time, etc.

        Parameters
        ----------
        psf : Kernel2D
            An arrays describing the PSF kernel of the image.
        exposure_time
            The exposure time of the simulated imaging.
        background_sky_level
            The level of the background sky of the simulated imaging.
        normalize_psf
            If `True`, the PSF kernel is normalized so all values sum to 1.0.
        read_noise
            The level of read-noise added to the simulated imaging by drawing from a Gaussian distribution with
            sigma equal to the value `read_noise`.
        add_poisson_noise
            Whether Poisson noise corresponding to photon count statistics on the imaging observation is added.
        noise_if_add_noise_false
            If noise is not added to the simulated dataset a `noise_map` must still be returned. This value gives
            the value of noise assigned to every pixel in the noise-map.
        noise_seed
            The random seed used to add random noise, where -1 corresponds to a random seed every run.

        ----------
        name
        image

            The scale of each pixel in arc seconds
        exposure_time_map
            An arrays representing the effective exposure time of each pixel.
        psf: PSF
            An arrays describing the PSF the simulated image is blurred with.
        background_sky_map
            The value of background sky in every image pixel (electrons per second).
        add_poisson_noise: Bool
            If `True` poisson noise_maps is simulated and added to the image, based on the total counts in each image
            pixel
