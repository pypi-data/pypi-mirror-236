    The images output by the `Visualizer` are customized using the file `config/visualize/plots.ini`.

        Visualizes a `Tracer` object.

        Images are output to the `image` folder of the `visualize_path` in a subfolder called `ray_tracing`. When

        visualizes the maximum log likelihood `Tracer` inferred by the search so far.

        Visualization includes individual images of attributes of the tracer (e.g. its image, convergence, deflection
        angles) and a subplot of all these attributes on the same figure.

        The images output by the `Visualizer` are customized using the file `config/visualize/plots.ini` under the

        """
        Certain `Inversion`'s have stochasticity in their log likelihood estimate.

        For example, the `VoronoiBrightnessImage` pixelization, which changes the likelihood depending on how different
        KMeans seeds change the pixel-grid.

        A log likelihood cap can be applied to model-fits performed using these `Inversion`'s to improve error and
        posterior estimates. This log likelihood cap is estimated from a list of stochastic log likelihoods, where
        these log likelihoods are computed using the same model but with different KMeans seeds.

        This function plots a histogram representing the distribution of these stochastic log likelihoods with a 1D
        Gaussian fit to the likelihoods overlaid. This figure can be used to determine how subject the fit to this
        dataset is to the stochastic likelihood effect.

        Parameters
        ----------
        stochastic_log_likelihoods
            The stochastic log likelihood which are used to plot the histogram and Gaussian.
        max_log_evidence
            The maximum log likelihood value of the non-linear search, which will likely be much larger than any of the
            stochastic log likelihoods as it will be boosted high relative to most samples.
        histogram_bins
            The number of bins in the histogram used to visualize the distribution of stochastic log likelihoods.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            A log likelihood cap which is applied in a stochastic model-fit to give improved error and posterior
