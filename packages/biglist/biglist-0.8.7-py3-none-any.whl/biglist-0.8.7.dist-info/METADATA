biglist
=======

The package ``biglist`` provides persisted, out-of-memory Python data structures
that implement the ``Sequence`` and ``Iterable`` interfaces with the capabilities of
concurrent and distributed reading and writing.
The main use case is processing large amounts of data that can not fit in memory.
Persistence can be on local disk or in cloud storage.
