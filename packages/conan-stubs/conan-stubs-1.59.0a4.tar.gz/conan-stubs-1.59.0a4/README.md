Type stubs for specific conan versions for authoring Conanfiles.
Versions of this package will correspond to the corresponding conan minor version.

* Generated with mypy via `stubgen -p conans --include-private` to fill up package, so everything resolves
* model.conan_file is handcrafted and functions are documented with basic descriptions
* Selectable string values are annotated and scm attribute is fully type hinted as TypedDict

## Why use type stubs instead of the bundled pylint plugin?

* Only usable with pylint, which is very unperformant and newer tools as Ruff can not work with this
* Methods are still missing (e.g. tool_requires)
* No autocomplete from pylint

## Limitations

* tool_requires, build_requires, requires are annotated with only their function signature
* settings are annotated by their setter information for the class variable
* Every annotation is in the file, but commented out
* See https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/3004 and https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release/issues/1735

### Details

Methods which also can be used as class variables can not be annotated directly:
```
...
tool_requires = "cmake/3.25.3"
def build_requirements(self):
    self.tool_requires("cmake/3.25.3")
```

The annotation would look like this with a property plus method, but can not be interpreted:
```
@property
@overload
def tool_requires(self) -> None: ...
@overload
def tool_requires(self, requirement: str, force_host_context: bool=False) -> None: ...
@tool_requires.setter
def tool_requires(self, value: Optional[Iterable[str]]): ...
```

## Supported conan versions:
  * 1.59

## Supported Python versions:
  * minimum 3.8
