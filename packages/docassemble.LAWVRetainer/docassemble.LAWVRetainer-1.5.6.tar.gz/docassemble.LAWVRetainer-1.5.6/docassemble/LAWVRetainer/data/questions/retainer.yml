terms:
  Free Services, Costs and Payments: |
    Legal services will be provided to me free of charge by Legal Aid of West Virginia. 
    My case may involve expenses for court fees, obtaining medical records, paying for process 
    servers and other charges or fees. Legal Aid will try to have these expenses waived or paid
     by the other side in this case. If the costs cannot be waived or paid by someone else, I will 
     pay them unless I am not able to do so. If I cannot pay the costs, Legal Aid may pay these charges 
     for me. I will pay Legal Aid back for costs they pay in my case from any back benefits or damages 
     recovered, although I understand Legal Aid will not take action to collect these costs from me 
     if that would cause me or my family undue hardship.
  Settlement Decisions: |
    Legal Aid of West Virginia will not settle my case without my agreement in advance, unless 
    I have authorized specific settlement terms in advance.
  Right to End Representation: |
    I can tell Legal Aid of West Virginia to stop representing me any time I want to do so, for any reason.
  Confidentiality and Disclosure of Information: |
    Legal Aid of West Virginia is a law firm. As a client of Legal Aid of West Virginia, I will make 
    available all the information I have relating to my case or my legal questions. As a client of Legal Aid 
    of West Virginia, my information is confidential. Confidential information will not be disclosed to 
    anyone who is not on the staff of Legal Aid of West Virginia without my permission, except as permitted 
    or required by the Rules of Professional Conduct, the legal ethics rules of West Virginia. Legal Aid 
    of WV may ask attorneys to assist me through its Pro Bono Program. I authorize Legal Aid of WV to 
    share my information with these attorneys or firms.
  Accurate Information, New Information and Changes in Information: |
    Everything I have told Legal Aid of West Virginia about my case is true as far as I know. I will 
    tell Legal Aid promptly if I find new information out about my case or if there are new incidents 
    to report. I understand it is my responsibility to tell Legal Aid of West Virginia immediately 
    about changes in my address, telephone number, my family income or the size of my household.
  Legal Aid’s Right to End Representation: |
    Legal Aid of West Virginia may stop representing me, but only when there is a good reason for 
    doing that. If I do not cooperate with instructions Legal Aid gives me, don't provide complete 
    or truthful information about my case, don't stay in touch with Legal Aid or if I do not report 
    changes in my phone number, address or income, Legal Aid may have to stop helping me. Legal Aid 
    will only stop representing me after making all reasonable efforts to tell me the reason and giving 
    me a chance to explain why representation should not be ended.
  Right to Make a Complaint: |
    I can make a complaint if I do not understand or approve of the work being done on my case or if 
    Legal Aid of West Virginia says it will stop representing me. Legal Aid will provide me a copy of 
    the “Statement of Client Rights” describing the procedure for making a complaint anytime I ask for one.
  Communication with Opposing Party: |
    I will not talk to the other side's lawyer without first having permission to do that from Legal Aid 
    of West Virginia. I will call Legal Aid right away if the attorney representing the other side tries 
    to talk to me.
  Copy of Agreement: |
    Legal Aid of West Virginia will give me a copy of this Retainer Agreement when it is signed by Legal 
    Aid of West Virginia, or at my request.
  Parties to the Retainer: |
    I understand that this agreement is between my and my advocate.
  Advocate is not an attorney: |
    I understand that my advocate is **NOT** an **ATTORNEY**.
  Transfer to an attorney: |
    I understand that I can request my case be referred to an attorney if issues arise that would meet the level of need for an attorney.
  Limitation of transferring to an attorney: |
    I understand that if my case is referred to an attorney that I will only be provided an attorney if I meet program guidelines, and if the attorney agrees to take my case after I have a consultation with the attorney.
  Free Services and costs: |
    I understand that assistance will be provided to me for free by Legal Aid of West Virginia. If there are costs that cannot be waived, Legal Aid may ask me to pay them if I am able. If I am not able, Legal Aid might be able to pay these costs.
  Confidentiality: |
    I understand that my information is confidential. Legal Aid of West Virginia will not disclose my confidential information without my permission, except as permitted or required by the legal ethical rules of West Virginia.
  Changes to information: |
    I understand it is my responsibility to keep Legal Aid and my advocate aware of any changes in my contact information.
  Right to discontinue: |
    I understand that I may discontinue services at any time. Discontinuing services does not affect my ability to request services in the future.
  Right to a complaint: |
    I understand that I have a right to file a complaint about the services I am receiving.
  Legal Aid’s right to discontinue: |
    Legal Aid of West Virginia may discontinue advocacy services or stop representing me before the completion of my case, but only when there is a good reason for doing that. Good reason includes but is not limited to; if I do not provide complete or truthful information about my case, don't stay in touch with Legal Aid or if I do not report changes in my phone number, address or income, Legal Aid may have to stop helping me. Legal Aid will only stop representing me after telling me the reason and giving me a chance to explain why advocacy services should not be ended.
  Child or dependent as FAST client: |
    I have been counseled that my child/dependent is the client of FAST and as their parent/guardian I am authorized to make decisions on their behalf. However, if there comes a point in the process where the advocate determines that the decisions I am making are not in their client's best interest, the advocate may discontinue advocacy services, but only after discussing the issue with me.
  Child or dependent as BHA client: |
    I have been counseled that my dependent/principal is the client of the Behavioral Health Advocacy program and as their guardian/legal representative I am authorized to make decisions for them or on their behalf. However, if there comes a point in the process where the advocate determines that the decisions I am making are not in their client's best interest, the advocate may discontinue advocacy services, but only after discussing the issue with me.
  Provide documentation: |
    I understand that I must provide Legal Aid of West Virginia with a copy of legal documentation that gives me decision making authority. I also understand that should that authority be removed, I am required to inform the advocate immediately.
