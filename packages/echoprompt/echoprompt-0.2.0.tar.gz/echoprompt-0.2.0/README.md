# echoprompt

Terminal prompt endowed with persistent memory that echoes last choices made and
provide them as default.

## Note

`echoprompt` is a thin wrapper library that exploits the fact that 
[Trapdoor](https://github.com/claymcleod/trapdoor) and [InquirerPy](https://github.com/kazhala/InquirerPy) features combine beautifully.
