interface: Demo System for Dynamic Simulation with ASM and ADM
==============================================================

Summary
-------
This modules contains a simple system to demonstrate dynamic simulation with more than one process models by including interface models (``ADMtoASM`` and ``ASMtoADM`` for anaerobic digestion model no.1 and activated sludge model no.1 [1]_) .

The system contains the entire Benchmark Simulation Model No. 1 (BSM1) [2]_ configuration as modeled in the `bsm1 <https://github.com/QSD-Group/EXPOsan/tree/main/exposan/bsm1>`_ module. But the waste activated sludge from the clarifier is sent to an anaerobic digester (AD), and the effluent from the AD is recycled into the first activated sludge bioreactor.

Load the system
---------------
.. code-block:: python

	>>> from exposan import interface as inter
	>>> inter.load()
	>>> sys = inter.sys
	>>> sys.simulate(method='BDF', t_span=(0, 15)) # the default 'RK45' method can't solve it
	>>> u = sys.flowsheet.unit # unit registry
	>>> # Check the states of any one or more components
	>>> fig, axis = u.AD1.scope.plot_time_series(u.AD1.components.IDs[:3])
	>>> fig
