## The Problem

When using nested routers in a FastAPI project its start-up time can get long quite fast.
That is because every router re-calculates the routes defined by a nested router when including it and the pre-calculated values by the nested router never gets used.

## The Solution

This library provides a modified APIRoute that defers the calculation of values to the first actual attribute access. A router which uses the route as a default is also provided.
