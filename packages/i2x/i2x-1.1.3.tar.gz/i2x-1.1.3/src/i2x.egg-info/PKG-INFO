# Interconnection Innovation e-Xchange (i2x) Open Test Systems 

This repository contains open grid network models and modeling scripts to 
test and compare different factors/measures (e.g., technoeconomic, social, 
equity, and engineering) that examine practices and policies for 
interconnection queue management and cost allocation.  This repository is 
used for engineering training bootcamps, interconnection study guides, and 
an interconnection roadmap for the [i2x project](https://energy.gov/i2x). 
 
[Documentation for Users and Developers](https://i2x.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

[Python Package](https://pypi.org/project/i2x/).

## Directories in this Repository

- **docs**; source files for building the documentation on ReadTheDocs for users and developers
- **hca**; source files for DER hosting capacity analysis
- **hubdata**; data files for interconnection metrics in the i2x data portal
- **soco**; source and data files for socio-grid co-simulation example
- **src/i2x**; source and data files for the *i2x* Python package for DER analysis, including the GUI
