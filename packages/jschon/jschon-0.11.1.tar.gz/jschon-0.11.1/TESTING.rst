Running the tests
=================
jschon is tested using the
`JSON Schema Test Suite <https://github.com/json-schema-org/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite>`_
(excluding optional and format tests), along with custom unit tests that make
use of the `Hypothesis <https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/>`_ testing library.

To run the tests, install jschon in editable mode, including testing dependencies::

    pip install -e git+https://github.com/marksparkza/jschon.git#egg=jschon[test]

Then, ``cd`` to the jschon source directory (``pip show jschon`` will give you
the location), and type ``tox``.

Note that a complete test run requires all of the supported Python versions
(3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11) to be installed on your system.

For detailed information on testing options, and to see which optional and
format tests are supported, see :doc:`contributing`.
