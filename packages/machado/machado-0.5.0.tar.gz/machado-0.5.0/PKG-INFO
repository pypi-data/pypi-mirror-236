# Machado

Machado is a Django application that contains tools to interact with a Chado database.
It provides users with a framework to store, search and visualize biological data.
Detailed documentation can be found in the **docs** directory ([Read the docs](http://machado.readthedocs.io)).


## Features
- There are data loaders for the major bioinformatics formats: fasta, gff, obo, bibtex, blast, interproscan, orthomcl
- The Machado API delivers data directly to the JBrowse genome browser
- The Haystack framework provides a very fast query interface using the Elasticsearch engine
