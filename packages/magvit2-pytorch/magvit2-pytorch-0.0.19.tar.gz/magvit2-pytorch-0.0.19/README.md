## MagViT2 - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of MagViT2 from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05737">Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation</a> in Pytorch

The Lookup Free Quantizer proposed in the paper can be found in a <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/vector-quantize-pytorch/blob/master/vector_quantize_pytorch/lookup_free_quantization.py">separate repository</a>. It should probably be explored for all other modalities.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install magvit2-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from magvit2_pytorch.magvit2_pytorch import VideoTokenizer

tokenizer = VideoTokenizer(
    image_size = 256,
    init_dim = 64,
    layers = (
        'residual',
        ('compress_space', 128),
        'residual',
        'residual',
        'attend_space',
        ('compress_time', 256),
        'attend_time'
    )
)

# get a ton of videos

videos = torch.randn(2, 3, 16 + 1, 256, 256) # (batch, channels, time, height, width)

# course it through the autoencoder

total_loss, loss_breakdown = tokenizer(videos, return_loss = True)
total_loss.backward()

# after much training above, you can get the tokenized codes

tokenizer.eval()
codes = tokenizer(videos, return_codes = True)

```

## Todo

- [ ] Magvit2 Tokenizer
    - [x] add adversarial loss
    - [x] implement the blurpool for antialiasing in discriminator
    - [x] LFQ should be able to pass loss breakdown (commitment and entropy), and forwarded to the return of the tokenizer
    - [ ] add trainer and manage discriminator training
    - [ ] completely generalize to multiple discriminators at different time scales (taking inspiration of multi-resolution discriminators from soundstream)
    - [ ] add local attention; even if not in the paper, i've seen too much not to use it

- [ ] MaskGit
