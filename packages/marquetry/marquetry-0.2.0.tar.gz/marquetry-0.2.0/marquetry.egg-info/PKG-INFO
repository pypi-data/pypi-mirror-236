# Marquetry
Marquetry means **Yosegi-zaiku**, a traditional Japanese woodworking technique, in Japan.
It is a beautiful culture craft originated in Japan, which is a box or ornament or so by small wooden pieces.
The design is UNIQUE, it depends on the arrangement of the wood tips.
I believe Deep Learning is similar with the concept.
Deep Learning models are constructed through the combination of the layers or functions.
Just as a slight variation in arrangement can result in a completely distinct model.
I want you can enjoy the deep/machine learning journey like
you craft a **Marquetry** from combination of various wood tips.

## About this Framework
You can use this framework for help your learning **Machine/Deep Learning**.
This framework is written only **Python**, so you can understand the implementation easily if you are python engineer.
For simplify the construct, there are un-efficiency implementation.
I develop this framework to enjoy learning the construction of the machine/machine learning not **Practical Usage**.
I hope to enjoy your journey!
