# Use-Motion-Api-Client

This is designed as a WiP api client for the task management app [Motion](https://www.usemotion.com/)
It's a wrapper around their API, documentation for which can be found [here](https://docs.usemotion.com/docs/motion-rest-api/44e37c461ba67-motion-rest-api)

## Disclaimer
I'm mostly working on this for an integration of my own between Todoist and Motion, so haven't mapped out all endpoints.
If there's an endpoint you'd like adding, create and issue and let me know!
