"""This script tests your python installation as it pertains to running project templates.

MSMBuilder supports Python 2.7 and 3.3+ and has some necessary dependencies
like numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn. This templated project enforces
some more stringent requirements to make sure all the users are more-or-less
on the same page and to allow developers to exploit more helper libraries.

You can modify the template scripts to work for your particular set-up,
but it's probably easier to install `conda` and get the packages we
recommend.
