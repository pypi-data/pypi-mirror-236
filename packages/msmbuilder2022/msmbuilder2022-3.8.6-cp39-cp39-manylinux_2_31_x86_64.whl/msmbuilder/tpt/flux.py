"""
Functions for calculating the fluxes through an MSM for a
given set of source and sink states.

These are the canonical references for TPT. Note that TPT
is really a specialization of ideas very familiar to the
mathematical study of Markov chains, and there are many
books, manuscripts in the mathematical literature that
cover the same concepts.
