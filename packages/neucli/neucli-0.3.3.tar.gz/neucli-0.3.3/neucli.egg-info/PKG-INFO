        # Neulabs CLI
        
        The neulabs CLI is used to aggregate all those activities and commands useful to various developers, reducing development costs and creating shared standards.
        The goal of `neucli` is to facilitate the generation and use of standard components such as documentation structure, GitHub actions for releases, and more.
        
        **Neucli** is based on [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/), a task runner that allows the creation of modular CLIs through YAML configurations. Each command has its own structure, some of them are Python modules, while others are simple Bash scripts. This approach makes it easy to add additional modules in various programming languages, and you can also create your own custom commands locally and add them to the CLI.
