# NHANES pyTOOL API

The NHANES pyTOOL 'API' is a Python library designed to simplify the process of accessing and analyzing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). NHANES is a program of studies conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States.

This tool provides an easy-to-use interface for retrieving NHANES datasets, allowing researchers, data science professionals, health professionals, developers and other stakeholders to explore NHANES data efficiently, enabling a wide range of health-related analyses and applications.

## Features

- **List Data Categories:** Retrieve a list of available NHANES data categories.
- **List Cycle Years:** Get a list of available NHANES cycle years.
- **Retrieve Variable Tables:** Fetch variable tables for specific data categories.
- **Get Data File Descriptions:** Obtain unique data file descriptions for a given data category and cycle years.
- **Retrieve Data:** Fetch data for specific data categories, cycle years, and data file descriptions.
- **Join Data Files:** Join data files based on common variables.
- **Find Common and Uncommon Variables:** Identify common and uncommon variables across multiple cycle years.


## Installation

To install the NHANES pyTOOL API, use `pip`:

```bash
pip install nhanes_pytool_api
```



# Important Note

**Attention:** In the current version of the NHANES pyTOOL API (version X.X.X), we do not provide a command-line interface (CLI) for direct use from the terminal. This means that you cannot run the API from the command line to access NHANES data. Instead, the API is designed for use as a library in Python scripts or applications.
###### Future Updates - We are continuously improving the NHANES Data API, and in future versions, we may consider adding a command-line interface for easier interaction with the API from the terminal. Until then, please use the API in your Python scripts or applications.
