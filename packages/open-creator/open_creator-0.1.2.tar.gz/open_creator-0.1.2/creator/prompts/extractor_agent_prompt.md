Extract one skill object from above conversation history, which is a list of messages.
Follow the guidelines below:
1. Only extract all the required properties mentioned in the 'extract_formmated_skill' function
2. When write the code for the skill,
    - Only write one function or one class object. DO NOT write any other code outside the function or class object except for import statements and initialization statements.
    - Remeber to import all the dependencies and packages you need. Expecially for methods and classes you used in the skill.
    - Function is preferred over class object.
    - AVOID write nested functions or inner functions (a function inside a function). This may cause the code parser to fail.
