class BaseWavefunctionSimulator(BaseCircuitRunner, WavefunctionSimulator):
    """ABC for implementing simple wavefunction simulators.

    This ABC is build around _get_wavefunction_from_native_circuit
    method. In general, most simulators wrap some third-party resource (
    a library, service, API etc.), which can only consume circuits comprising
    operations from a given set. Such operations are called "native" to
    the given simulator, whereas other operations are called "nonnative".

    The idea of simulating arbitrary circuit is thus as follows:

    - split circuit into alternating consecutive parts of only native and
      only "nonnative" operations.

    - start with some initial state

    - for each part:

      - if it is native, run it via third-party resource, save the new
        statevector

      - if it is nonnative, apply each operation in the sequence using
        operation.apply(previous_statevector). Save the new statevector.

      Last saved statevector is the wavefunction of the total circuit.

      For this to work, subclasses of this ABC should implement
      _get_wavefunction_from_the_native_circuit method.

    Note:
        Since this class inherits all the limitations of BaseCircuitRunner.
        The _run_and_measure function is implemented via sampling from the
        wavefunction. Care must be taken when using third-party service that
        implements more sophisticated/more performant sampling method not
        involving direct computation of the whole wavefunction. In such cases,
        using BaseWavefunctionSimulator ABC will likely result in huge
        performance hit.
