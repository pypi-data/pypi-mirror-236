What's new
==========

**Scan Test Endpoints Script**
 * New function to discover Client Side and Server Side BDD test flows through the CI/CD Probe.

**CI/CD Probe Integration Enhancements**
 * For enhanced BDD test execution, flexibility and security, two new parameters were added:
    * --exclude_pattern: to specify the exclude pattern (using a regular expression) for the BDD test flows.
    * --cicd_probe_key: to enhance the security of the CI/CD Probe API calls.

**Bug Fixes**
 * Fixed the issue related with loading the manifest file when the path directories included spaces.
 * Fixed the evaluate_test_results script to correctly use the provided input parameter instead of relying on default value.
