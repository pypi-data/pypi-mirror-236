Description: # Magical
        
        A simple magic package.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install via pip: `pip install potatomagical`
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        from potatomagical.magic import do_magic
        
        print(do_magic("Potato"))  # "Potato is now potatomagical!"
        ```
        
        ## Packaging
        
        First, make sure you have the necessary tools installed.
        
        ```
        pip install twine wheel
        ```
        
        Then, create a distribution package.
        
        
        ```
        python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        ```
        
        
        ## Uploading to PyPI
        
        First, check your package with twine.
        
        ```
        twine check dist/*
        ```
        
        
        If everything is okay, upload your package to PyPI.
        ```
        twine upload dist/*
        ```
        
        Remember, you'll need to create an account on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) if you haven't already.
        
        This is a very basic example. Depending on your project, you might need to add more information to `setup.py`, add a `MANIFEST.in` file, etc. Check the [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/) for more details.
