This is a copy of the py2neo package to restore the version history that got deleted.
It's not possible to re-upload a deleted version of a package to PyPI.
So if you rely on, for example, `py2neo ~= 4.1.0` in your project, you can simply switch to `py2neo-history ~= 4.1.0`.
If your project works with py2neo 2021.2.3 or above, you can keep using `py2neo` as usual.

Note that this project will not get any updates past version 2021.2.3.

To install, run `pip install py2neo`

For information on installation and usage, visit http://py2neo.org/.
