[content.Abstract]

text='''
This report \textit{demonstrates} how to create semi-automatically generated reports based on the pyerk-framework.
The abstract can also contain \LaTeX{} source code such as formulas $y = \frac{\x^2}{2}.$ It also serves as fixture-data to develop and test the respective software framework.
