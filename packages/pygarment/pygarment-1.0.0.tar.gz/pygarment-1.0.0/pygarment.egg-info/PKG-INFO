# GarmentCode: Programming Parametric Sewing Patterns

![Examples of garments sampled from GarmentCode configurator](https://github.com/maria-korosteleva/GarmentCode/blob/main/assets/img/header.png)

Official Implementation of [GarmentCode: Programming Parametric Sewing Patterns](https://igl.ethz.ch/projects/garmentcode/), including architecture and garment programs.

## Documents

1. Detailed Installtion instructions: [Installation](https://github.com/maria-korosteleva/GarmentCode/blob/main/docs/Installation.md)
2. How to run the configurator & adjust parameters: [Running](https://github.com/maria-korosteleva/GarmentCode/blob/main/docs/Running.md)

## Navigation

### Library

[PyGarment](https://github.com/maria-korosteleva/GarmentCode/tree/main/pygarment) is the core library described in the GarmentCode paper. It contains the base types (Edge, Panel, Component, Interface, etc.), as well as edge factory and various helpers and operators that help you design sewing patterns.  

Install with 
```
pip install pygarment
```

### Examples

* [assets/garment_programs/](https://github.com/maria-korosteleva/GarmentCode/tree/main/assets/garment_programs/) contains the code of garment components designed using PyGarment. 
* [assets/design_params/](https://github.com/maria-korosteleva/GarmentCode/tree/main/assets/design_params/), [assets/body_measurements/](https://github.com/maria-korosteleva/GarmentCode/tree/main/assets/body_measurments/) contain examples of design and body measurements presets corresponding to the designs and retargeting results showcased in our GarmentCode paper. They can be used in both GarmentCode GUI and `test_garments.py` script.

> NOTE: [assets/design_params/default.yaml](https://github.com/maria-korosteleva/GarmentCode/blob/main/assets/design_params/default.yaml) is the setup used by GUI on load. Changing this file results in changes in the GUI initial state =)

## Attribution & Body use disclaimer
We are using samples from [SMPL](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/) body model as base for [Body Model examples](https://github.com/maria-korosteleva/GarmentCode/tree/main/assets/Bodies). 

### Disclaimer
Due to the restrictions of the SMPL license, we cannot share all 3D models of the body shapes used in our paper, except for the base average bodies for male and female versions of SMPL. We nevertheless share the approximate body measurements of the thin and the full-bodied models to showcase the adaptation of the patterns to different body types.
