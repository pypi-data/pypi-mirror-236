class Node(HasToDict, ABC):
    """
    Nodes are elements of a computational graph.
    They have input and output data channels that interface with the outside
    world, and a callable that determines what they actually compute, and input and
    output signal channels that can be used to customize the execution flow of their
    graph;
    Together these channels represent edges on the dual data and execution computational
    graphs.

    Nodes can be run to force their computation, or more gently updated, which will
    trigger a run only if all of the input is ready (i.e. channel values conform to
    any type hints provided).

    Nodes may have a `parent` node that owns them as part of a sub-graph.

    Every node must be named with a `label`, and may use this label to attempt to create
    a working directory in memory for itself if requested.
    These labels also help to identify nodes in the wider context of (potentially
    nested) computational graphs.

    By default, nodes' signals input comes with `run` and `ran` IO ports which force
    the `run()` method and which emit after `finish_run()` is completed, respectfully.
    These signal connections can be made manually by reference to the node signals
    channel, or with the `>` symbol to indicate a flow of execution. This syntactic
    sugar can be mixed between actual signal channels (output signal > input signal),
    or nodes, but when referring to nodes it is always a shortcut to the `run`/`ran`
    channels.

    The `run()` method returns a representation of the node output (possible a futures
    object, if the node is running on an executor), and consequently `update()` also
    returns this output if the node is `ready`. Both `run()` and `update()` will raise
    errors if the node is already running or has a failed status.

    Calling an already instantiated node allows its input channels to be updated using
    keyword arguments corresponding to the channel labels, performing a batch-update of
    all supplied input and then calling `run()`.
    As such, calling the node _also_ returns a representation of the output (or `None`
    if the node is not set to run on updates, or is otherwise unready to run).

    Nodes have a status, which is currently represented by the `running` and `failed`
    boolean flag attributes.
    Their value is controlled automatically in the defined `run` and `finish_run`
    methods.

    Nodes can be run on the main python process that owns them, or by setting their
    `executor` attribute to `True`, in which case a
    `pyiron_workflow.executors.CloudPickleExecutor` will be used to run the node on a
    new process on a single core (in the future, the interface will look a little
    different and you'll have more options than that).
    In case they are run with an executor, their `future` attribute will be populated
    with the resulting future object.
    WARNING: Executors are currently only working when the node executable function does
        not use `self`.

    This is an abstract class.
    Children *must* define how `inputs` and `outputs` are constructed, and what will
    happen `on_run`.
    They may also override the `run_args` property to specify input passed to the
    defined `on_run` method, and may add additional signal channels to the signals IO.

    # TODO: Everything with (de)serialization and executors for running on something
    #       other than the main python process.

    Attributes:
        connected (bool): Whether _any_ of the IO (including signals) are connected.
        failed (bool): Whether the node raised an error calling `run`. (Default
            is False.)
        fully_connected (bool): whether _all_ of the IO (including signals) are
            connected.
        future (concurrent.futures.Future | None): A futures object, if the node is
            currently running or has already run using an executor.
        inputs (pyiron_workflow.io.Inputs): **Abstract.** Children must define
            a property returning an `Inputs` object.
        label (str): A name for the node.
        outputs (pyiron_workflow.io.Outputs): **Abstract.** Children must define
            a property returning an `Outputs` object.
        parent (pyiron_workflow.composite.Composite | None): The parent object
            owning this, if any.
        ready (bool): Whether the inputs are all ready and the node is neither
            already running nor already failed.
        running (bool): Whether the node has called `run` and has not yet
            received output from this call. (Default is False.)
        signals (pyiron_workflow.io.Signals): A container for input and output
            signals, which are channels for controlling execution flow. By default, has
            a `signals.inputs.run` channel which has a callback to the `run` method,
            and `signals.outputs.ran` which should be called at when the `run` method
            is finished.
            Additional signal channels in derived classes can be added to
            `signals.inputs` and  `signals.outputs` after this mixin class is
            initialized.

    Methods:
        disconnect: Remove all connections, including signals.
        draw: Use graphviz to visualize the node, its IO and, if composite in nature,
            its internal structure.
        on_run: **Abstract.** Do the thing.
        run: A wrapper to handle all the infrastructure around executing `on_run`.
