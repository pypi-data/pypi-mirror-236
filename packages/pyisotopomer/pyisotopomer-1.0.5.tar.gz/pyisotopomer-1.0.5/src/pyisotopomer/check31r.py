    Calculates error in 31R from gamma and kappa values.

    USAGE: error = check31r([gamma1, kappa],
            row,
            isotopeconstants,
            ref1,
            ref2)

    DESCRIPTION:
        Calculates 31R from eqn. (10) in Kelly et al. (in revision for RCMS);
        compares calculated 31R to measured 31R used to calculate gamma and kappa.

    INPUT:
        :param f: gamma and kappa
        :type f: list
        :param R: array with dimensions n x 10 where n is the number of reference pairs.
        The six columns are 31R, 45R, 46R, 15Rbulk, and 17R for reference #1, then
        the same for reference #2, from left to right.
        :type R: numpy array, dtype=float
        :param isotopeconstants: ref_tag, d15Na, and d15Nb of reference materials
            entered into the "scale_normalization" tab of the excel template
        :type isotopeconstants: Pandas Dataframe
        :param ref1: string or number containing name of reference material #1,
        as written in constants.csv
        :type ref1: str, int, or float
        :param ref2: string or number containing name of reference material #2,
        as written in constants.csv
        :type ref1: str, int, or float

    OUTPUT:
        :returns: Numpy Array with dimensions n x 2 where n is the number of measurements.
        The two columns are 31R error for ref 1 and ref 2, equal to (31R_calculated/31Rmeasured - 1)*1000
