# PyWavelet Documentation

PyWavelet is a python package designed to help work with GW waveforms in the WDM wavelet domain.

Currently, PyWavelet is in the early stages of development and is based entirely off {cite}`MCDigmanWDMTransformRepo`.

The package is not yet available on PyPI, but can be installed from source. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/avivajpeyi/pywavelet)
