def get_SRT(system, biomass_IDs, wastage=None, active_unit_IDs=None):
    """
    Estimate sludge residence time (SRT) of an activated sludge system.

    Parameters
    ----------
    system : obj
        The system whose SRT will be calculated for.
    biomass_IDs : tuple[str]
        Component IDs of active biomass.
    wastage : iterable[:class:`WasteStream`]
        Streams with wasted biomass.
    active_unit_IDs : tuple[str], optional
        IDs of activated sludge units. The default is None, meaning to include
        all units in the system.

    Returns
    -------
    [float] Estimated sludge residence time in days.

    .. note::

        [1] This function uses component flowrates of the system's product `WasteStream`
        for calculation, which does not carry time-dependent information. So, it
        should not be used for a system with dynamic influents.
        [2] The units included in calculation must all have :func:`get_retained_mass`
        to calculate the retained biomass.

    Examples
    --------
    `bsm1 system <https://github.com/QSD-Group/EXPOsan/blob/main/exposan/bsm1/system.py>`_
