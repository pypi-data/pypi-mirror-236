# REMix

REMix is addressing research questions in the field of energy system analysis.
The main focus is on the broad techno-economical assessment of possible future
energy system designs and analysis of interactions between technologies. This
will allow system analysts to inform policy makers and technology researchers
to gain a better understanding of both the system and individual components.

The documentation of REMix is hosted online: [REMix docu](https://dlr-ve.gitlab.io/esy/remix/framework/).

Do not hesitate to ask questions about REMix in the [openmod forum](https://forum.openmod.org/tag/remix).

## Key Features

To know if REMix is apt for your project take into account these key features:

**Large Models**:
REMix is developed with large models in mind.
This means high spatial and technological resolutions.

**Path Optimization**:
Multi-year analyses are built into the framework.

**Custom accounting approaches**:
The indicator module allows for a very flexible definition of what contributes to the objective functions.

**Flexible modeling**:
There is not a single way of modeling technologies in REMix.
With the flexible [modelling concept](https://dlr-ve.gitlab.io/esy/remix/framework/dev/documentation/modeling-concept/index.html) you can find the best way of integrating your modeling needs.

**Multi-criteria optimization**:
Apart from running a cost minimization, also other criteria like ecological or resilience indicators can be taken into account in the objective function.

## How to use

To run a REMix model, users need a recent [GAMS](https://www.gams.com/)
installation (version 37 or above).

To install REMix, clone this repository, create a new Python environment and install it through pip.

Clone with ssh:

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.com:dlr-ve/esy/remix/framework.git
```

Clone with https:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/dlr-ve/esy/remix/framework.git
```

```bash
cd framework
conda create -n remix-env python
conda activate remix-env
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Please find the extensive [installation instructions in the online documentation](https://dlr-ve.gitlab.io/esy/remix/framework/dev/getting-started/install-remix.html).

Additionally, a data project is required which contains the parametrization of
the model scope and technologies. We provide
[example projects](https://gitlab.com/dlr-ve/remix/projects), which can be used
to gain first experience with running the REMix optimization model.

To run your model, you can use the command line interface:

```bash
conda activate remix-env
remix run --datadir=/path/to/data/folder/of/your/model/data
```

All configuration options available with the command line tool are documented
in the [technical documentation](https://dlr-ve.gitlab.io/esy/remix/framework/dev/documentation/tech-docs/index.html).
