# Welcome to REMix

REMix is addressing research questions in the field of energy system analysis.
The main focus is on the broad techno-economical assessment of possible future
energy system designs and analysis of interactions between technologies.

This will allow system analysts to inform policy makers and technology
researchers to gain a better understanding of both the system and individual
components.

## Key Features

To know if REMix is apt for your project take into account these key features:

**Large Models**:
REMix is developed with large models in mind.
This means high spatial and technological resolutions.

**Path Optimization**:
Multi-year analyses are built into the framework.

**Custom accounting approaches**:
The indicator module allows for a very flexible definition of what contributes to the objective functions.

**Flexible modeling**:
There is not a single way of modeling technologies in REMix.
With the {ref}`core modules<modeling_concept_label>` you can find the best way of integrating your modeling needs.

**Multi-criteria optimization**:
Apart from running a cost minimization, also other criteria like ecological or resilience indicators can be taken into account in the objective function.
