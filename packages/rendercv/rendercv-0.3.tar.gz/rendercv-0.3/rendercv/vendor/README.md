# TinyTeX

This directory contains `TinyTeX` folder with all the TinyTeX binaries. This is done to make RenderCV usable without installing LaTeX.

TinyTeX can be downloaded from here. For RenderCV, I deleted most of the files to get a minimal TinyTeX that can render the CV.

Currently, only Windows binaries are uploaded. Linux support is planned.
