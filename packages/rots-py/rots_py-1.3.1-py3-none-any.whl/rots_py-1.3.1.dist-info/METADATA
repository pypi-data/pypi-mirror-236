Python implementation of the __Reproducibility-Optimized Test Statistic (ROTS)__ for gene ranking from the [Bioconductor ROTS](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ROTS.html) package.

ROTS belongs to a familly of gene ranking statistics that aim to rank genes based on evidence for differential expression in two-group comparisons. ROTS is a non-parametric method that uses a permutation test to assess the significance of the observed differential expression. ROTS is designed to be robust to outliers and to be reproducible across different studies.

__NOTE__: Data should have at least two non-null values per row for both groups.

# Installation 
```
pip install rots-py
```

# Usage
```python  
from rotspy import rots, plot_rots, get_summary

# Load data
data = ...
group = ...

# Run ROTS
result = rots(data, group, B=500, log=True, verbose=True, progress=True)

# Get the ranking
ranking_statistic = result["d"]
fdr = result["fdr"]
logFC = result["logfc"]
pvalue = result["p"]

# Get the summary of result with FDR threshold of 0.05
summary = get_summary(result, fdr_c=0.05)

# Plot volcano plot from the results
plot_rots(result, fdr=0.05, type="volcano")
```

# Methods

## rots(...)
Runs the ROTS analysis on the given data. Returns a Python dictionary.

## Parameters
- `data`: A pandas dataframe with genes/proteins as rows and samples as columns. (required)
- `group`: A pandas series with the group labels for each sample. (required)
- `B`: Number of permutations to perform. Default is 500. (optional)
- `K`: Top-list size. (optional)
- `paried`: Whether the samples are paired. Default is False. (optional)
- `seed`: Seed for the random number generator. Default is None. (optional)
- `a1`: Parameter for the ROTS statistic. If both a1 and a2 are specified optimization step is skipped. (optional)
- `a2`: Parameter for the ROTS statistic. If both a1 and a2 are specified optimization step is skipped. (optional)
- `log`: Whether data is log-transformed. Default is False. (optional)
- `progress`: Whether to show a progress bar. Default is False. (optional)
- `verbose`: Whether to print the progress of the analysis. Default is False. (optional)

## Returns
Python `dict` object with the following keys:
- `data`: The original dataframe used for the input
- `B`: Number of permutations
- `d`: ROTS test statistic for each gene/protein
- `logfc`: Log2 fold change
- `p`: P-value
- `FDR`: False Detection Rate
- `a1`: Optimized parameter a1
- `a2`: Optimized parameter a2
- `k`: Top list size (*`None` if optimization skipped*)
- `R`: Reproducibility score (*`None` if optimization skipped*)
- `Z`: Z-score (*`None` if optimization skipped*)
- `ztable`: Z-score table
- `cl`: Group labels for each sample

## get_summary(...)
Returns a summary of the ROTS results.

## Parameters
- `rots_res`: The result of the `rots` function. (required)
- `fdr_c`: The FDR threshold for the summary. Default is `None` (required if `n_features` is not specified)
- `n_features`: The number of top rows to show in the summary. Default is `None` (required if `fdr` is not specified)
- `verbose`: Whether to print the summary. Default is `True` (optional)

## Returns
A pandas dataframe with the following columns:
- `Row`: The row names of the input dataframe
- `ROTS Statistic`: The ROTS statistic for each row
- `pvalue`: The p-value for each row
- `FDR`: The FDR for each row

## plot(...)
Plots the ROTS results. 

## Parameters
- `rots_res`: The result of the `rots` function. (required)
- `fdr`: The FDR threshold for the plot. Default is `0.05` (required)
- `type`: The type of plot to generate. (required)
    - "volcano"
    - "heatmap"
    - "ma"
    - "reproducibility"
    - "pvalue"
    - "pca"
