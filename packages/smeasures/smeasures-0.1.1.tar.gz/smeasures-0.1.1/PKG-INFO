smeasures - Python package for measuring resource utilization and execution time

The `smeasures` package provides a simple way to capture resource utilization and time taken for a given code block or method. It uses the `psutil` library to collect system resource usage data, and provides a decorator that can be used to wrap a function or code block to measure its execution time and resource usage.

Installation:

To install `smeasures`, simply run:

    pip install smeasures

Usage:

To use `smeasures`, import the `measure` decorator from the `smeasures` package, and apply it to the function or code block you want to measure:

    from smeasures import measure

    @measure
    def my_function():
        # code to measure here

This will print out the execution time and resource usage of the `my_function` code block.

Dependencies:

`smeasures` requires the following dependencies:

- `psutil`
- `time`
- `threading`
- `gc`
