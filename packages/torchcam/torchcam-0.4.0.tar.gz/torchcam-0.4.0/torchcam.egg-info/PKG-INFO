           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## Quick Tour

### Setting your CAM

TorchCAM leverages [PyTorch hooking mechanisms](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/former_torchies/nnft_tutorial.html#forward-and-backward-function-hooks) to seamlessly retrieve all required information to produce the class activation without additional efforts from the user. Each CAM object acts as a wrapper around your model.

You can find the exhaustive list of supported CAM methods in the [documentation](https://frgfm.github.io/torch-cam/methods.html), then use it as follows:

```python
# Define your model
from torchvision.models import resnet18
model = resnet18(pretrained=True).eval()

# Set your CAM extractor
from torchcam.methods import SmoothGradCAMpp
cam_extractor = SmoothGradCAMpp(model)
```

*Please note that by default, the layer at which the CAM is retrieved is set to the last non-reduced convolutional layer. If you wish to investigate a specific layer, use the `target_layer` argument in the constructor.*



### Retrieving the class activation map

Once your CAM extractor is set, you only need to use your model to infer on your data as usual. If any additional information is required, the extractor will get it for you automatically.

```python
from torchvision.io.image import read_image
from torchvision.transforms.functional import normalize, resize, to_pil_image
from torchvision.models import resnet18
from torchcam.methods import SmoothGradCAMpp

model = resnet18(pretrained=True).eval()
# Get your input
img = read_image("path/to/your/image.png")
# Preprocess it for your chosen model
input_tensor = normalize(resize(img, (224, 224)) / 255., [0.485, 0.456, 0.406], [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])

with SmoothGradCAMpp(model) as cam_extractor:
  # Preprocess your data and feed it to the model
  out = model(input_tensor.unsqueeze(0))
  # Retrieve the CAM by passing the class index and the model output
  activation_map = cam_extractor(out.squeeze(0).argmax().item(), out)
```

If you want to visualize your heatmap, you only need to cast the CAM to a numpy ndarray:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Visualize the raw CAM
plt.imshow(activation_map[0].squeeze(0).numpy()); plt.axis('off'); plt.tight_layout(); plt.show()
```

Or if you wish to overlay it on your input image:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from torchcam.utils import overlay_mask

# Resize the CAM and overlay it
result = overlay_mask(to_pil_image(img), to_pil_image(activation_map[0].squeeze(0), mode='F'), alpha=0.5)
# Display it
plt.imshow(result); plt.axis('off'); plt.tight_layout(); plt.show()
```

## What else

### Documentation

The full package documentation is available [here](https://frgfm.github.io/torch-cam/) for detailed specifications.

### Demo app

A minimal demo app is provided for you to play with the supported CAM methods! Feel free to check out the live demo on [![Hugging Face Spaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-Spaces-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/frgfm/torch-cam)

If you prefer running the demo by yourself, you will need an extra dependency ([Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)) for the app to run:

```
pip install -e ".[demo]"
```

You can then easily run your app in your default browser by running:

```
streamlit run demo/app.py
```

**The base CAM method cannot work with architectures that have multiple fully-connected layers*

This benchmark was performed over 100 iterations on (224, 224) inputs, on a laptop to better reflect performances that can be expected by common users. The hardware setup includes an [Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10750H](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/201837/intel-core-i710750h-processor-12m-cache-up-to-5-00-ghz.html) for the CPU, and a [NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 with Max-Q Design](https://www.nvidia.com/fr-fr/geforce/graphics-cards/rtx-2070/) for the GPU.

You can run this latency benchmark for any CAM method  on your hardware as follows:

```bash
python scripts/eval_latency.py SmoothGradCAMpp
```

*All script arguments can be checked using `python scripts/eval_latency.py --help`*
