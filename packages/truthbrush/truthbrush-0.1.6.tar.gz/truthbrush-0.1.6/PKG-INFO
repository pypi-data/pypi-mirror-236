# truthbrush
Truthbrush is an API client for Truth Social. Truthbrush is built and maintained by the [Stanford Internet Observatory](https://io.stanford.edu).

Currently, this tool can:

* Search for users, statuses, or hashtags
* Pull a user's statuses
* Pull the list of "People to Follow" or suggested users
* Pull "trending" hashtags
* Pull "trending" Truth posts
* Pull ads
* Pull a user's metadata

Truthbrush is designed for academic research, open source intelligence gathering, and data archival. It pulls all of the data from the publicly accessible API.

## Installation

Truthbrush is not yet available on PyPI. To install it, run `pip install git+https://github.com/stanfordio/truthbrush.git`, or clone the repository and run `pip3 install .`. Provided your `pip` is setup correctly, this will make `truthbrush` available both as a command and as a Python package. **Note that Truthbrush requires Python 3.9 or higher.**

After installation, you will need to set your Truth Social username and password as environmental variables.

`export TRUTHSOCIAL_USERNAME=foo`

`export TRUTHSOCIAL_PASSWORD=bar`

You may also set these variables in a `.env` file in the directory from which you are running Truthbrush.

## Contributing

Contributions are encouraged! For small bug fixes and minor improvements, feel free to just open a PR.

Be sure to also follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Thanks!

Development setup (ensure you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed):

```sh
poetry install
poetry shell
truthbrush --help # will use your local copy of truthbrush
```


If you prefer not to install Poetry in your root environment, you can also use Conda:

```sh
conda create -n truthbrush-env python=3.9
conda activate truthbrush-env

conda install -c conda-forge poetry
poetry install
```

To run the tests:

```sh
pytest

# optionally run tests with verbose logging outputs:
pytest --log-cli-level=DEBUG -s
```

Please format your code with `black`:

```sh
black .
```
