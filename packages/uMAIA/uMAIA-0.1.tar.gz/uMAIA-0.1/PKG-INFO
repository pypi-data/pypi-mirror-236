`wget https://packages.gurobi.com/9.1/gurobi9.1.2_linux64.tar.gz` to the directory you want to install it in.

`tar -xzvf gurobi9.1.2_linux64.tar.gz`

### GPU usage restrictions
If you intend on applying uMAIA's normalisation algorithm on a GPU, please note that JAX will automatically use between 75 and 90 % of available GPU memory. To indicate that you would only like to allocate memory that is needed, you may export an environment variable after activating the environment with `export XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE=false`
