Utah Project
============

Utah Project is designed to help developers build full stack web app solutions in python. It does this by integrating many of the 
components in the python ecosystem into one software stack realized in a preconfigured reference application.
It begins with a set of base libraries to handle common needs when building web applications 
and fronts them with flask. It takes into consideration the following problems: 

1. Externalized Content Management and Delivery
2. Authentication
3. Authorization
4. Profile Management
5. Configuration Bootstrapping
6. Site Navigation
7. Command processing
8. Robust and Dynamic Page Templating
9. Internationalization
10. Server Configuration (For CentOS and Redhat)
11. APIs

Consumption Models
------------------
Utah can be consumed in two modes. 

1. Canned installable RPM for Linux Systems
2. Workspace for building your own applications

Installing our canned application on a server is pretty straight forward and out 
of the box will provide a nice content management and delivery solution.  To get 
started follow our `Quick Start`_ guide

The workspace gives you the ability to mix your functionality with our out of 
the box services. Our command processing is all based on `flask`_. Your first question 
might be why flask? Simple enough; flask is awesome and the most straight forward 
way to implement web functionality in python. If you know flask, adding 
functionality will be a simple proposition. The workspace comes with all 
of the component dependancies preconfgiured in a working application ready 
to have your functionality added to it. In addtion the workspace comes with an RPM spec 
which is needed to build your application into your own RPM so your 
application is server deployable.


Setting up a workspace is also straightforward.  To do so follow our `workspace setup`_ guide.
