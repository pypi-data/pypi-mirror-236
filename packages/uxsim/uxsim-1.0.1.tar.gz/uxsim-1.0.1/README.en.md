# UXsim: An open source macroscopic and mesoscopic traffic simulator in Python

This repository introduces UXsim, a free, open-source macroscopic and mesoscopic network traffic flow simulator developed in Python. 
It is suitable for simulating large-scale (e.g., city-scale) vehicular transportation.
It computes dynamic traffic flow in a network by using traffic flow models commonly utilized by transportation research.

Simple example is summarized in [Jupyter Notebook Demo](https://github.com/toruseo/UXsim/blob/main/demos_and_examples/demo_notebook_01en.ipynb).

Note that UXsim is a significant expansion of the traffic flow simulator UroborosX, which is included in the book "[Macroscopic Traffic Simulation: Fundamental Mathematical Theory and Python Implementation](https://www.coronasha.co.jp/np/isbn/9784339052794/)" (Author: [Toru Seo](https://toruseo.jp/), Publisher: [Corona Publishing Co., Ltd.](https://www.coronasha.co.jp/)). The basic operating principles remain the same; for details, please refer to the book.

## Main Features

- Dynamic network traffic simulation with a given network and time-dependent OD demand (i.e., dynamic traffic assignment). Specifically, the following models are used jointly:
	- Newell's simplified car-following model (X-Model)
	- Lagrangian Incremental Node Model
	- Dynamic User Optimum-type Route Choice Model (with inertia)
- Implementation of traffic management schemes (e.g., traffic signals, inflow control, route guidance, congestion pricing).
- Basic analysis of simulation results (e.g., trip completion rate, total travel time, delay), and their export to pandas.DataFrame and CSV files.
- Visualization of simulation results (e.g., time-space diagram, MFD, network traffic animation).

## Contents

- `uxsim.py`: UXsim main code
- directory `utils`: Necessary files and modules for UXsim
- directory `dat`: Scenario files
- directory `demos_and_examples`: Tutorials and examples of UXsim
- `README.md` and others: Files for explanations etc. Not necessary for simulation

## Usage

The [Jupyter Notebook Demo](https://github.com/toruseo/UXsim/blob/main/demos_and_examples/demo_notebook_01en.ipynb) summarizes the basic usage and features.

To use, place your Python code or Jupyter Notebook in the same folder as the `uxsim.py` file and the `utils` directory and use `from uxsim import *`. For more details, refer to the examples in the `demos_and_examples` directory.

Formal deployment as a Python module will be addressed in the future.

### Execution Environment

Uses Python version 3. Additionally, please install the following modules in advance:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pillow
- tqdm
- SciPy
- pandas

## Calculation Example

Approximately 60,000 vehicles pass through a 10km x 10km grid network in 2 hours. The computation time is about 40 seconds on a standard desktop PC. Visualization of link traffic conditions (thicker lines mean more vehicles, darker colors mean slower speeds) and some vehicle trajectories:
