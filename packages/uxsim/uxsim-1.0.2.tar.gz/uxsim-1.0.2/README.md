# UXsim: Network traffic flow simulator in pure Python

[(日本語の説明書はこちら)](https://github.com/toruseo/UXsim/blob/main/README.jp.md)

This repository introduces *UXsim*, a free, open-source macroscopic and mesoscopic network traffic flow simulator developed in Python. 
It is suitable for simulating large-scale (e.g., city-scale) vehicular transportation.
It computes dynamic traffic flow in a network by using traffic flow models commonly utilized by transportation research.
UXsim would be especially useful for scientific and educational purposes because of its simple, lightweight, and customizable features; but of course users are free to use UXsim for any purpose.

Simple example is summarized in [Jupyter Notebook Demo](https://github.com/toruseo/UXsim/blob/main/demos_and_examples/demo_notebook_01en.ipynb).


## Main Features

- Dynamic network traffic simulation with a given network and time-dependent OD demand (i.e., dynamic traffic assignment). Specifically, the following models are used jointly:
	- Newell's simplified car-following model (X-Model)
	- Lagrangian Incremental Node Model
	- Dynamic User Optimum-type Route Choice Model (with inertia)
- Implementation of traffic management schemes (e.g., traffic signals, inflow control, route guidance, congestion pricing).
- Basic analysis of simulation results (e.g., trip completion rate, total travel time, delay), and their export to pandas.DataFrame and CSV files.
- Visualization of simulation results (e.g., time-space diagram, MFD, network traffic animation).
- Can be flexibly customized by users thanks to pure Python implementation.

## Main files

- `uxsim` directory: UXsim main package
	- `uxsim/uxsim.py`: UXsim main code
	- `uxsim/utils.py`: UXsim utilities code
 	- `uxsim/utils` directory:  UXsim utilities files
- `demos_and_examples` directory: Tutorials and examples of UXsim
- `dat` directory: Sample scenario files

## Usage

First, install UXsim package using pip:
```
pip install uxsim
```
or download the `uxsim` directory from this Github repo and place it to your local directory. 
The former is required if you want to customize UXsim’s internal logic.

Then import the module using:
```python
from uxsim import *
```

The [Jupyter Notebook Demo](https://github.com/toruseo/UXsim/blob/main/demos_and_examples/demo_notebook_01en.ipynb) summarizes the basic usage and features.
For the further details, please see [demos_and_examples](https://github.com/toruseo/UXsim/tree/main/demos_and_examples) and [UXsim technical documentation](https://toruseo.jp/UXsim/docs/index.html).

## Simulation Example

Approximately 60,000 vehicles pass through a 10km x 10km grid network in 2 hours. The computation time was about 30 seconds on a standard desktop PC. Visualization of link traffic states (thicker lines mean more vehicles, darker colors mean slower speeds) and some vehicle trajectories:
