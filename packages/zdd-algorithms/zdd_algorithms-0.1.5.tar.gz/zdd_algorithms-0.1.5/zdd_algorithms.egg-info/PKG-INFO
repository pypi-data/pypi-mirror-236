Description: # Zdd Algorithms
        
        Zdd algorithms is a Python library that implements the zdd algorithms that are described on the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-suppressed_decision_diagram). With some additional functions for creating a zdd from a set, a set from a zdd and a function to create an image of the zdd.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install zdd_algorithms.
        
        ```bash
        pip install zdd-algorithms
        ```
        
        ## Zero-suppressed decision diagram
        
        Zdd are a special kind of binary decision diagram that represents a set of sets.

        This Zdd represents the set {{1,3},{2,3},{1,2}} \
        Every node has a exactly 2 outgoing edges LO and HI. The LO edge is usally represented by a dotted line and the HI edge with a solid line.
        The easiest way to get the set from a visual zdd by hand is to take every path from the root node to the {ø} node(⊤ is also often used as a label for this node).\
        Every path represents a set and all paths combined is the set of sets that the Zdd represents.
        In this example there are 3 paths from the root node to {ø}. \
        If a node has a LO edge in the path that nodes value is ignored. All the other values together represents a set \
        3 → 2 → {ø} This path represents the set {3,2} \
        3 ⇢ 2 → 1 → {ø} This path represents the set {1,2} \
        3 → 2 ⇢ 1 → {ø} This path represents the set {1,3} \
        Therefor this zdd represents the set {{1,3},{2,3},{1,2}}
        
        ## Usage
        
        Since we cannot have a set of sets in python we use set of frozensets when converting a zdd to the set representation and vice versa
        
        ```python
        import zdd_algorithms as zdd
        
        # Creates a set of frozensets
        set1 = {
            frozenset({1,3}),
            frozenset({2,3})
        }
        # Create zdd from the set. This zdd represent now the set {{1,3},{2,3}}
        zdd1 = zdd.to_zdd(set1)
        
        set2 = {
            frozenset({1,2})
        }
        zdd2 = zdd.to_zdd(set2)
        
        # Create an union of two zdds
        union = zdd.union(zdd1, zdd2)
        
        # Create .PNG image of the zdd. This needs graphviz to be installed! 
        zdd.create_image(union)
        ```
